ORIGINAL UI GUIDANCE

kay, I understand you want me to remove the "x" markers (representing completed tasks) from the UI-related items previously extracted.

However, looking back at the extracted UI list from the plan, all the specific UI development tasks under the detailed checklist (Phases 1-5) were already marked with [ ], indicating they were Not Started.

Therefore, removing the "x" doesn't actually change those specific checklist items. The main places the "x" appeared in the original document were for non-UI tasks or broader categories that might have included some completed non-UI sub-tasks.

Here is the list of UI-related items again, ensuring all specific tasks are shown as not started [ ]:
