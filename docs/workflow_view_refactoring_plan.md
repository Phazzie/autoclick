# Workflow View Refactoring Plan

This document outlines the plan to refactor the large `workflow_view.py` file into smaller, more manageable components following SOLID, KISS, DRY, and SRP principles.

## Current Issues

- The `workflow_view.py` file is too large (over 2000 lines)
- It has multiple responsibilities (canvas management, node rendering, connection handling, etc.)
- It has experienced merge conflicts and encoding issues
- It's difficult to maintain and extend

## Refactoring Goals

1. Break up the file into smaller, focused components
2. Each component should have a single responsibility
3. Improve maintainability and testability
4. Prevent future merge conflicts and encoding issues
5. Make it easier to extend with new features

## Component Breakdown

### 1. Base Components

- `workflow_view.py` - Main view class (orchestrates other components)
- `canvas_manager.py` - Manages the canvas, zooming, panning, grid
- `node_renderer.py` - Handles node rendering and visual properties
- `connection_renderer.py` - Handles connection rendering and visual properties
- `property_panel.py` - Manages the properties panel
- `toolbox_panel.py` - Manages the toolbox panel

### 2. Event Handlers

- `node_event_handler.py` - Handles node-related events (click, drag, etc.)
- `connection_event_handler.py` - Handles connection-related events
- `canvas_event_handler.py` - Handles canvas-related events
- `toolbox_event_handler.py` - Handles toolbox-related events

### 3. Models

- `node_model.py` - Data model for nodes
- `connection_model.py` - Data model for connections
- `workflow_model.py` - Data model for the entire workflow

## Implementation Steps

1. Create the new files with proper class definitions
2. Move related code from `workflow_view.py` to the appropriate files
3. Update imports and references
4. Test each component individually
5. Test the integrated system
6. Update documentation

## File Structure

```
src/ui/views/
├── workflow_view.py (main orchestrator)
├── components/
│   ├── canvas_manager.py
│   ├── node_renderer.py
│   ├── connection_renderer.py
│   ├── property_panel.py
│   └── toolbox_panel.py
├── handlers/
│   ├── node_event_handler.py
│   ├── connection_event_handler.py
│   ├── canvas_event_handler.py
│   └── toolbox_event_handler.py
└── models/
    ├── node_model.py
    ├── connection_model.py
    └── workflow_model.py
```

## Testing Strategy

1. Create unit tests for each component
2. Create integration tests for component interactions
3. Create end-to-end tests for the entire workflow view

## Migration Strategy

1. Implement the new components alongside the existing code
2. Gradually migrate functionality from the old code to the new components
3. Once all functionality is migrated, remove the old code
4. This approach ensures that the application remains functional during the refactoring process

## Timeline

1. Week 1: Create the base components and models
2. Week 2: Create the event handlers and integrate with the base components
3. Week 3: Test and refine the implementation
4. Week 4: Complete documentation and finalize the refactoring

## Preventive Measures

To prevent future issues with the workflow view:

1. Use the `.gitattributes` file to ensure consistent line endings and encoding
2. Use the pre-commit hook to check for merge conflicts and null bytes
3. Use the `.editorconfig` file to ensure consistent editor settings
4. Follow the SOLID, KISS, DRY, and SRP principles in all new code
5. Write comprehensive tests for all components
6. Document all components and their interactions
