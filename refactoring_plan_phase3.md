# Refactoring Plan - Phase 3: UI Integration and Documentation (IN PROGRESS)

**Objective:**

To complete the refactoring process by integrating the refactored service architecture with the UI components and providing comprehensive documentation. This phase focuses on ensuring that the UI components correctly use the refactored services and that the codebase is well-documented.

**Goals:**

1. **UI Integration:** Update UI adapters to use the refactored service architecture.
2. **Documentation:** Create comprehensive documentation for the refactored codebase.
3. **Final Verification:** Ensure all tests pass and the codebase complies with SOLID, KISS, and DRY principles.
4. **Knowledge Transfer:** Provide clear documentation for future developers.

## Phase 3 Steps (Remaining Tasks):

### 1. Integration with UI Adapters (In Progress)

-   [x] Update existing UI adapters to use the new architecture (WorkflowAdapter, VariableAdapter, ConditionAdapter, DataSourceAdapter, ErrorAdapter, LoopAdapter, ReportingAdapter, CredentialAdapter, ActionAdapter completed)
-   [x] Create integration tests for UI adapters (WorkflowAdapter, VariableAdapter, ConditionAdapter, DataSourceAdapter, ErrorAdapter, LoopAdapter, ReportingAdapter, CredentialAdapter, ActionAdapter tests completed)
-   [ ] Verify that UI components correctly access services
-   [ ] Ensure proper dependency wiring and configuration

### 2. Documentation and Final Verification (Pending)

-   [ ] Update documentation to reflect the new service architecture.
-   [ ] Create architecture diagrams to visualize component interactions.
-   [ ] Verify that all tests pass and code coverage is adequate.
-   [ ] Conduct a final review to ensure compliance with SOLID, KISS, and DRY principles.

-   [ ] Create architecture diagrams to visualize component interactions.
-   [ ] Verify that all tests pass and code coverage is adequate.
-   [ ] Conduct a final review to ensure compliance with SOLID, KISS, and DRY principles.

## Current Focus Areas:

-   `src/ui/adapters/` directory (UI Adapters)
-   `src/ui/views/` directory (UI Views)
-   `tests/ui/` directory (UI Tests)
-   Documentation files

## Next Steps:

Continue with the remaining tasks in Phase 3:

1. Update existing UI adapters to use the new architecture
2. Create integration tests for UI adapters
3. Complete documentation and final verification
