# AUTOCLICK UI Implementation Checklist

## 0. React UI Integration Roadmap

**IMPORTANT UPDATE (2023)**: This section represents our new development roadmap for migrating from the Tkinter-based UI to a modern React/Next.js UI. This migration addresses the recurring merge conflicts and null byte issues in workflow_view.py while providing a more maintainable and user-friendly interface.

The roadmap is structured as a 7-week plan divided into three phases, with each phase building on the previous one. It strictly adheres to SOLID, KISS, and SRP principles to ensure code quality and maintainability. Each component and file has a single, well-defined responsibility, and the architecture is designed to be extensible without modification of existing code.

This plan was developed after careful analysis of the current codebase and represents the optimal path forward for the AUTOCLICK application.
